Health Insurance Cost Estimation and Analysis Using Data Science.

Project Title: Health Insurance Cost Estimation and Analysis.

Description:
This project is an end-to-end data science application developed to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on various variables. The project uses a real-world dataset obtained from Kaggle and follows a step-by-step approach to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and model evaluation.

Key Steps:

  Creating a Google Colaboratory File: The project is structured as a (.ipynb) file, with detailed explanations provided through comments. This ensures transparency and reproducibility.
  
  Importing Required Libraries: Essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Sklearn are imported to facilitate data analysis and modeling.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis : Through data visualization techniques, meaningful insights are extracted from the dataset. Relationships between variables like BMI, smoker status, region, age, and charges are examined and visualized.
  
  Data Preprocessing: Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is applied using Standard Scaling.
  
  Model Selection: Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, are trained on the preprocessed data.
  
  Hyper-parameter Optimization: The best-performing model (Random Forest Regression) is fine-tuned using Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters for improved performance.
  
  Model Evaluation: The optimized model's performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error .

By following this structured approach, the project provides insights into health insurance cost factors and demonstrates key concepts in data science, including data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
